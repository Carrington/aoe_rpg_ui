I) Intense Action
  A) When Intense Action begins, each actor may declare Initiative maneuvers.
    1) Initiative maneuvers take place before combat begins, and each activates simultaneously.
    2) Where Initiative maneuvers conflict, resolution is described in either the maneuver itself (in the case of maneuvers which are identical) or the interrupting maneuver.
  B) Once Initiative maneuvers are complete, the first Sortie begins.
    1) Each Sortie lasts [SortieRealSeconds] seconds of narrative time.
    2) Each Sortie is divided into 10 steps.
      a) Each Step represents one possible action taken by an Actor.
        i) All Actors have a single action in a given step.
          -) Most actors have a specific action they can perform in a given step; however, some actors may have a composite action:
            *) In the case of very fast acting Actors, an action taken within a Step will represent many different actions, potentially. These will be adjudicated as described by their specific capabilities.
              --) e.g. Ianthe is capable of acting 7 times per step. However, her powers dictate a certain amount of momentum in a specific direction. Thus, she can't shove someone out of the way, hurl Violence, defend, and then activate four further Knacks during a single step. Her abilities are not written that way. Instead, she may elect to attack seven times, or move seven times, or, perhaps, attack three times and then move four times.
            *) Some actors have the ability to combine multiple actions by virtue of their physical structure (e.g. someone with perfect ambidexterity) or other advantages (e.g. someone who telekinetically wields several weapons with). These actions will be summed up in a single action as presented on their sheet.
            *) In either case, composite actions should be decided upon and configured beforehand.
