# How to Play

You don't ever have to make a random check in Age of Endings, if you choose not to. Most actions can be taken by comparing your skill level to a set difficulty. If you want to try and reach for something beyond your current skill level, you can take a gamble and draw a card! This may result in an increase in ability for the current check, or it may result in your actor overthinking what they're doing and failing at what should be a simple feat!

If you decide not to draw, your skill level is compared to a flat difficulty. You succeed if your skill exceeds the difficulty.

Before deciding whether to roll, you may ask the GM if you can get a _**Gut Check**_ about the situation. This is intended to tell you whether or not a gamble is advisable, and is governed by your _**Intuition**_ and your pool of _**Calliope Chips**_. If you have a chip available, you may make an _**Inuition Check**_ to determine if you might miss your goal with your current skill level in a straight check.

If you gamble, you pick a card from a standard deck of cards. If you have picked Clubs or Spades (Swords or Cups), you _subtract_ the number from your skill! If you draw Hearts or Diamonds (Wands or Pentacles), you _add_ the number to your skill!

_Note for SKB: eventually there'll be more Tarot flava here, but I'm still working it all out. I have a lot of very bad ideas to sift through._

_**Examples**_:

* You want to see if you notice anything relevant to a murder investigation in the immediate room. Each clue has a set threshold, as assigned by the GM. Your actor has an _**Investigation**_ skill rating of 30. You have no _**Calliope Chips**_ available to do a gut check, so you don't roll; the GM gives you five clues, each a difficulty lower than 30 to spot, but witholds the critical clues that are at difficulty 35 and 40.
* Alternatively, you take the gamble anyway. You draw the 9 of Hearts! You add 9 to your skill, making it a 39, and granting you one of the two hidden, critical clues!
* Or, if you do have a _**Calliope Chip**_, you can spend it and make an _**Intuition Check**_ (described below) to see what the max difficulty is. You succeed at the check and determine that the max difficulty on a clue in this scene is 40. You take the gamble and draw a King of Clubs! Now your final skill rating is 17 (30 - King (13)) and you get even less clues than you would have if you hadn't gambled!

## Opposed Checks

This is all well and good for static checks against a set difficulty, but what happens when you're up against another actor? To deal with this, we must discuss _**Opposed Checks**.

An _**Opposed Check**_ has no static difficulty by its nature. The decision now becomes whether to stand on your static skill or risk the gamble nnd possibly lowering it, yes, but factoring into that choice is the possibility that while your static rating may be high enough to beat your opponent's, _they_ may choose to gamble!.

When an opposed check begins, both actors (player vs player, or player vs GM) simultaneously pick a red or black card. A red card means you're standing on your static rating. A black card means you intend to gamble. Once this is decided, secretly, both actors reveal their cards and the check proceeds accordingly. The player with the highest rating wins.

# Actors
# Intense Action

_**Intense Action**_ is the phase of play where each moment matters. Examples of _**Intense Action**_ include combat, dramatic action, or tense social interactions.

When _**Intense Action**_ begins, each player takes their _**Action Deck**_ and selects 10 actions from it. These are the maneuvers the actor is ready and willing to act on without conscious thought.
* Every 5 seconds of _**Intense Action**_ is represented by a _**Sortie**_.
  * _**Sorties**_ are divided into 10 _**Steps**_, each representing half a second.

Because some actors in Age of Endings are radically faster than others, each actor is assigned an _**Initiative**_.

_**Initiative**_ is graded 1 to 10.
* These grades represent an increasing number of actions per step.
  * 1 - 1
  * 2 - 2
  * 3 - 3
  * 4 - 5
  * 6 - 8
  * 7 - 13
  * 8 - 21
  * 9 - 34
  * 10 - 55

_**Initiative**_ ranks greater than 6 are the province of _**Mythical**_ actors. In general, unless combat between such equivalent actors can be represented, their actions are best represented narratively.

  _(For SKB) Ianthe's Initiative is 8, the highest Initiative of any known Initiate (non-Netherite) in the current era (including Marya). Priya's Initiative is only 6; however, she has a special facet that slows the Initiative of all fighters nearby her by 2-4 ranks, to a minimum of 1 (Pathos can violate this, as can certain very arcane Logos abilities). Marya's Initiative is also 6, and Ria and Amy's Inititives are 7_.

  While a high _**Initiative**_ may seem unilaterally advantageous, there are some limitations:

   * You can only have 10 readied actions in your _**Action Deck**_ by default. Some abilities may increase this, but there are limits.
    * Some of these actions may have a _**multiplier**_, meaning it can be representative of up to a certain number of actions.
      * _**Example**: Rapid Punch may be used up to 5 times in a single step, if enough actions are available given the actor's **Initiative**_.
  * Some actions _cannot be performed_ at certain _**Initiatives**_. Other actions may be unadvisable at certain _**Initiatives**_.
      * _**Examples**_:
        * Picking a lock with standard tools cannot be performed at a higher _**Initiative**_ than 1.
        * Dragging or pushing an allied actor at an _**Initiative**_ faster than their own may cause them harm.
        * Trying to catch bullets is nearly impossible at _**Initiatives**_ less than 5, and is somewhat likely to result in injury below 7.
* Some actions may allow you to act at an increased _**Initiative**_ if you discard some or all other actions for this _**Sortie**_.
  * Examples:
    * __Battlefield Master__ is a Warlord __Knack__ generally associated with Strategoi. While in __Lightning Mind__, the Warlord may discard all actions besides __Battlefield Master__ for this **Sortie** and instead make use of this __Knack__ to maneuver their allies around the battlefield (with risk to their allies, see above) and take actions at a much higher rate than they could otherwise (in essence, the Warlord is lending speed to their allies' _**Initiatives**_).
      * This sort of action is referred to as a _**Maneuver**_.
    * __Giga Drill Breaker__ is a __Knack__ of the Invoker of Simon the Driller, allowing the user to perform the attack in lieu of any other action for the rest of the_**Sortie**_, but doing so in response to any other actor's action.
      * This sort of action is referred to as an _**Interrupt**_.
* Some actions seem to take place in a much longer span of time than actually elapses as they are performed.
  * Example:
    * __Selene, grant me your beauty!__ is an __Invocation Knack__ of the Invoker of Selene. It involves an elaborate transformation sequence during which time appears to freeze for all onlookers; this is a psychic illusion, and no time elapses during the transformation.
      * This sort of action is known as _**Grandstanding**_.
